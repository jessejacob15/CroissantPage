                The Community is present in seven countries, with different
                houses and missions. It brings together members from different

                priests...). Directed and organized by nuns, the religious
                project relies on partners and donations to keep helping those
                that have no ceiling above their heads, no food on their tables
                and no Christ in their hearts.
