        CROissant is the first food meta on the Cronos network. We strive to
        make impact through providing crypto donations to those in need through
        the NYC FOOD BANK, & documenting the impact of ever so important social
        workers. Croissants are flakey, but we are not. We aim to establish
        partnerships with social organizations & bakeries throughout the world.
        Pastries are sweet & comforting, with the power of community and
        decentralized finance there is no reason everyone should not be able to
        have a bite. -CROissant Team
